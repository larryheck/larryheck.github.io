To address this problem, this paper introduces Conversational Tables (cTBL), a three-step encoder-decoder approach to retrieve tabular information and generate dialogue responses grounded on the retrieved information. cTBL uses Transformer encoder embeddings for Dense Table Retrieval and obtains up to 5% relative improvement in Top-1 and Top-3 accuracy over sparse retrieval on the HyrbiDialogue dataset. Additionally, cTBL performs tabular knowledge retrieval using both encoder and decoder models, resulting in up to 46% relative improvement in ROUGE scores and better human evaluation for response generation on HyrbiDialogue.",

  abstract = "Visual question answering (VQA) lies at the intersection of language and vision research. It functions as a building block for multimodal conversational AI and serves as a testbed for assessing a model’s capability for open-domain scene understanding. While progress in this area was initially accelerated with the 2015 release of the popular and large dataset VQA, new datasets are required to continue this research momentum. For example, the 2019 Outside Knowledge VQA dataset OKVQA extends VQA by adding more challenging questions that require complex, factual, and commonsense knowledge. However, in our analysis, we found that 41.4% of the dataset needed to be corrected and 10.6% needed to be removed. This paper describes the analysis, corrections, and removals completed and presents a new dataset: OK-VQA Version 2.0. To gain insights into the impact of the changes on OK-VQA research, the paper presents results on state-of-the-art models retrained with this new dataset. The side-by-side comparisons show that one method in particular, Knowledge Augmented Transformer for Vision-and-Language, extends its relative lead over competing methods. The dataset is available online.",

    abstract = "Large, transformer-based pretrained language models like BERT, GPT, and T5 have demonstrated a deep understanding of contextual semantics and language syntax. Their success has enabled significant advances in conversational AI, including the development of open-dialogue systems capable of coherent, salient conversations which can answer questions, chat casually, and complete tasks. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle with tasks that involve higher levels of reasoning - including commonsense reasoning that humans find trivial. This paper presents a survey of recent conversational AI research focused on commonsense reasoning. The paper lists relevant training datasets and describes the primary approaches to include commonsense in conversational AI. The paper also discusses benchmarks used for evaluating commonsense in conversational AI problems. Finally, the paper presents preliminary observations of the limited commonsense capabilities of two state-of-the-art open dialogue models, BlenderBot3 and LaMDA, and its negative effect on natural interactions. These observations further motivate research on commonsense reasoning in conversational AI.",

    abstract = "As humans, we experience the world with all our senses or modalities (sound, sight, touch, smell, and taste). We use these modalities, particularly sight and touch, to convey and interpret specific meanings. Multimodal expressions are central to conversations; a rich set of modalities amplify and often compensate for each other. A multimodal conversational AI system answers questions, fulfills tasks, and emulates human conversations by understanding and expressing itself via multiple modalities. This paper motivates, defines, and mathematically formulates the multimodal conversational research objective. We provide a taxonomy of research required to solve the objective: multimodal representation, fusion, alignment, translation, and co-learning. We survey state-of-the-art datasets and approaches for each research area and highlight their limiting assumptions. Finally, we identify multimodal co-learning as a promising direction for multimodal conversational AI research.",
