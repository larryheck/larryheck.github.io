I am a Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech, affiliated with the Machine Learning Center (ML@GT), and an adjunct Professor in the School of Interactive Computing. I hold the Rhesa S. Farmer Distinguished Chair of Advanced Computing Concepts, and am a Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar. 

I am interested in <span class="font-weight-bold">Conversational AI</span>  and Natural Language Processing. My research goal is to create an autonomous <bf> digital human</bf> that can freely communicate with humans in <bf>open, mixed-reality</bf> domains.
