I am a Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Tech, affiliated with the Machine Learning Center (ML@GT), and an adjunct Professor in the School of Interactive Computing. I hold the Rhesa S. Farmer Distinguished Chair of Advanced Computing Concepts, and am a Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar. I am interested in <bf> Conversational AI</bf> and <bf> Natural Language Processing</bf>. My research goal is to create an autonomous <bf> digital human</bf> that can freely communicate with humans in <bf>open, mixed-reality</bf> domains.
