I am interested in next generation <span class="font-weight-bold">Virtual Assistants</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">Conversational AI</span>, and <span class="font-weight-bold">Natural Language and Speech Processing</span>. My research goal is to create an autonomous <span class="font-weight-bold">digital human</span> that can freely communicate with humans in <span class="font-weight-bold">open, mixed-reality</span> domains.
