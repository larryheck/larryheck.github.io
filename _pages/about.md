I am a Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech, affiliated with the Machine Learning Center (ML@GT), and an adjunct Professor in the School of Interactive Computing. I hold the Rhesa S. Farmer Distinguished Chair of Advanced Computing Concepts, and am a Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar. 

I am interested in <span class="font-weight-bold">next geneeration virtual assistants</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">Conversational AI</span>, and <span class="font-weight-bold">Natural Language and Speech Processing</span>. My research goal is to create an autonomous <span class="font-weight-bold">digital human</span> that can freely communicate with humans in <span class="font-weight-bold">open, mixed-reality</span> domains.
